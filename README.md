# reviewer-web-app
A simple web based application that is use for creating reviewer notes, like remembering a set of syllabus and their definition

How usefull was this app?
Well, as a student I always come across memorazing a sets of syllabus or words and thier defination.
For example, what is the meaning of ICT. This app aid students in their review before an examination.
Works like an ordinary text editor but includes text highlighing and a simple quiz generator.
